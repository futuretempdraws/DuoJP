# DuoJP

An open-source, offline-first application for Japanese language acquisition.

## About The Project

Many contemporary language learning applications require a persistent internet connection and guide users along a predetermined, linear curriculum. DuoJP is designed as a direct alternative, offering a comprehensive and flexible learning environment that operates entirely offline.

The core philosophy is "download and go." This application empowers users to take full control of their studies without being tethered to the internet or rigid lesson plans. It is a tool built for focused, deep, and personalized learning.

## Key Features

*   **Personalized Local Accounts:** Create and manage user profiles directly on your device. All progress, settings, and customizations are saved locally, ensuring complete privacy and functionality without an internet connection.
    *   **Customization:** Personalize your profile with a profile picture and select from various custom themes to tailor your learning environment.
    *   **Exportable Data:** Your learning data belongs to you. Export your account progress and settings at any time for backup or transfer.
    *   **Automatic Saving:** All settings and lesson progress are saved automatically, providing a seamless experience.

*   **Comprehensive Curriculum:** A unified system for mastering the essential components of the Japanese language.
    *   **Kana:** Drills and lessons for both Hiragana and Katakana.
    *   **Kanji:** Detailed study of Kanji, including stroke order, readings, and contextual usage.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Curated vocabulary lists organized by theme and proficiency level.
    *   **Grammar:** Clear explanations and exercises for fundamental grammar points.

*   **Fully Offline Operation:** Following an initial download of the course content, DuoJP operates without any need for an internet connection. This makes it ideal for learning during commutes, travel, or in any environment with limited connectivity.

*   **Non-Linear Learning Path:** The curriculum is structured non-linearly, empowering users to select their own learning path. Focus on specific areas of difficulty or branch out to new topics as you see fit, rather than following a single, forced progression.

*   **Intelligent Review System:** To ensure long-term retention, the application will integrate effective learning algorithms, such as a Spaced Repetition System (SRS), to prompt reviews at optimal intervals.

*   **Modern User Interface:** A clean, intuitive, and distraction-free interface designed to facilitate focus and enhance the learning experience.
